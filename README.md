# Kasper-Project

## there is a way in ".about .container img", where you can crop an image and smalling the area between it and the element above it(for this example) or below it:
"bottom: -120px;"
"margin-top: -120px;"
and ofcourse with using the "overflow: hidden;" with its Parent.

## We could've construct the quote using "<q></q>", and changing the double quotes with fontawesome icons by using psuedo elements(Before & After).

## An Example for a mandatory action to use fontawesome icons as psuedo elements is:
font-family: "Font Awesome 6 Free";
content: "\24";
font-weight: 900;
